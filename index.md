## Unity Foot Sliding Remover

Finding the right velocity for your character to avoid foot sliding is a time consuming process, and even worse: You can't adjust the speed later.

Using the Unity Foot Sliding Remover you can skip all of that boring fine tuning and leave the job to the machine.

By analyzing the animation's foot speed the script then automatically adjusts the speed of the animation to completely remove foot sliding.

### Usage

Simply attach the script to your animated character - or any other game object - and chose the animator that is supposed to be affected.

Now add the speed multiplier strings of your animation to the script's parameter list and watch the magic happen!
